# Linux Server

This set of guides outlines a comprehensive process for setting up a home server using Debian Linux. It begins with installing a minimal Debian system, providing a lightweight and efficient base for the server. The next step involves setting up Docker, a powerful containerization platform that allows for easy deployment and management of various applications. Following this, the guides cover the installation and configuration of Nginx, a high-performance web server and reverse proxy. Nginx is used to host and manage live websites, ensuring efficient handling of web traffic. Finally, the process includes integrating Cloudflare, a content delivery network and security service. Cloudflare not only enhances the security of the server but also provides Dynamic DNS (DDNS) functionality, allowing the server to maintain a consistent domain name despite changing IP addresses. This setup creates a robust, secure, and flexible home server environment capable of hosting websites and various other services.
